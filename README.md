# Jennifer Sukut's Personal Website // Resume // About Info

Hello & Welcome!

This is my personal website where you get to see a list of my skills, some work history, and a whole lot about me {including my appreciation for colors that embody the happiness of a pushpop in summer}!

This web application was built using Vite + React and coded in VSCode, based off a design I put together in Figma - with custom-made gradient images made using MeshGradient. I've utilized React's brilliant Functional Components and their helpful Props to put the different website pieces together, along with a smattering of React Hooks to get the animation-ball rolling. I've used React-Scroll to navigate between the different scrollable elements, and the fantastic Intersection-Observer to keep watch and implement fun little transformations as you navigate down the page.

[Take a look around](https://jennysukut.github.io/personal-website/) and drop me a line if you'd like to work together!
